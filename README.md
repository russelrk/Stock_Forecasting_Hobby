# Stock Sentiment Analysis and Forecasting (Ongoing)

### Overview
In this project, we harness the power of web scraping and pre-trained language models to perform sentiment analysis on stock news headlines. Furthermore, we implement machine learning algorithms to forecast stock movements using a combination of sentiment analysis results and historical stock data.

### Features

- **Web Scraping:** Gathers the latest stock news headlines from specified portals, providing fresh data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes pre-trained language models to perform sentiment analysis on the retrieved headlines, determining if the sentiment is positive or negative.
- **Stock Forecasting:** Leverages machine learning algorithms to predict stock movements based on the sentiment analysis results combined with historical stock data.


#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher and pip (Python Package Installer) installed on your system.

### Usage

1. Adjust the "news_url" and "stock_keyword" variables in the "main.py" file to indicate the news portal URL and the specific stock keyword you are analyzing.
2. Run the script by entering "python main.py" in your terminal or command prompt.
